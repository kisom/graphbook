GraphBook
==========

A graph-based personal knowledge repository.


Testing
-------

+ ``make test`` is preferred; it runs the black formatter to minimise
  code style inconsistencies and the [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)
  type checker before running the tests.
+ Otherwise, this project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

Status
------

+ Basic notebook persistence and loading.
